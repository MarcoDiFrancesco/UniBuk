# Software Engineering II Project

> We need to develop an online service for e-commerce in particular related to selling and buying used books for the university or notes and resources. We want to deliver a web version of this service.

## Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, DISI, University of Trento
This is going to be a web application we will develop as both project and exam for the "Software Engineering II" course. It is based on `node.js` as backend server plus some more stuff I'm really not sure about.
