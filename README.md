# Software Engineering II Project
## Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, DISI, University of Trento

This is going to be a web application we will develop as both project and exam for the "Software Engineering II" course. It is based on `node.js` as backend server plus some more stuff I'm really not sure about.

## Statement of our main project idea
> We need to develop an online service for e-commerce that will allow University students to sell, buy and search for used books, notes and resources. We want to deliver a web	version of this service and a client application.
